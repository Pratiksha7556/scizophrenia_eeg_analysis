# EEG-Based Schizophrenia Detection Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on detecting schizophrenia using EEG (electroencephalogram) signals. We apply machine learning and deep learning techniques, including SVM, CNN, ensemble models, and feature selection methods, to classify subjects as healthy or schizophrenic. The analysis also includes explainable AI using SHAP for model interpretability.
- Preprocessing and feature extraction from EEG signals
- PCA and ANOVA for dimensionality reduction and feature selection
- Models used: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN
- Ensemble stacking for improved classification performance
- Explainable AI: SHAP visualizations for feature importance
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
